People Service (new name?)
==========================

The idea of the people service is to provide a distributed, surveillance resistant (from: Google/Facebook, ISP, Government, Hacker), social network. This has support for realtime messaging (text, voice, video), non-realtime messaging (i.e. email), and social network style posting (status, pictures, video, etc).

Core to this idea is that each user has a point of access on a publically accessible server on the internet (and/or Tor hidden service). This server will generally only contain encrypted content, except for content that the user explicitly chooses to make publically available (a profile picture, school attended, blog posts, etc or none at all).
